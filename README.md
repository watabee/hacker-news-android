## How to setup Firebase

1. Create Firebase project in the Firebase console.
    - [Add Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
    - This app has two build types (`debug` and `release`) and they are different application id, so you need to create projects corresponding to them.
2. Download `google-services.json` and put it in the `app` directory.
3. Set up Crashlytics in the Firebase console.
